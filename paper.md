# Development of Global Vulnerability (GloVuln) to natural disaster

## Introduction

There are a few vulnerability assessments to natural hazard has been done in global scale. 
For example, INFORM (UNISDR)
Jongman (2015) used 

These analyses can estimate global impacts or support national and international disaster managements and their decision makings. 

In local scale, however, specific vulnerability data (e.g., high resolution) is required and preferred to support local and international agencies on their disaster managements in both pre- and post-managements.

Furthermore, recent natural disaster (e.g., climate, hydrologic, earthquake, etc.) risk forecasts systems or assessments have been operated in high resolusion and large-scale (e.g., continental and global)

## Data
Extensive data investigation has been done.\
We obtained cencus data from [Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) - International](https://international.ipums.org/international/),
